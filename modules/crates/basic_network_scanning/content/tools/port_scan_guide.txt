# Port Scanning with Nmap

## Overview
Port scanning is a fundamental technique in network security assessments. Nmap is a powerful tool for discovering open ports and services on a target host.

## Basic Port Scan
To scan the most common 1,000 ports on a target:

```bash
nmap <target>
```

## Scan Specific Ports
To scan specific ports (e.g., 22, 80, 443):

```bash
nmap -p 22,80,443 <target>
```

## Scan All Ports
To scan all 65,535 TCP ports:

```bash
nmap -p- <target>
```

## Service Version Detection
To detect service versions on open ports:

```bash
nmap -sV <target>
```

## Output Formats
- Normal: Default output
- Grepable: `-oG <file>`
- XML: `-oX <file>`

## Best Practices
- Scan during authorized windows
- Document your findings
- Use with permission only

## Exercise
Try scanning a test host and identify which ports are open and what services are running.
