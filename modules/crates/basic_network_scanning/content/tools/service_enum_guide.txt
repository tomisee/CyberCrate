# Service Enumeration with Nmap

## Overview
Service enumeration is the process of identifying running services and their versions on open ports. This helps in vulnerability assessment and network mapping.

## Service Version Detection
To detect service versions on open ports:

```bash
nmap -sV <target>
```

## Script Scanning
Nmap includes a powerful scripting engine (NSE) for advanced enumeration:

```bash
nmap --script=default,vuln <target>
```

- `default`: Runs a set of default scripts
- `vuln`: Runs vulnerability detection scripts

## OS Detection
To attempt to determine the operating system:

```bash
nmap -O <target>
```

## Output Example
```
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
```

## Best Practices
- Use version detection to identify potential vulnerabilities
- Combine with script scanning for deeper insights
- Document all findings

## Exercise
Run a service version scan and identify the software and versions running on your test host.
